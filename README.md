Data collection from 2 websites  

Wikipedia link of provinces and cities: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Vietnam)  

First Link: After collecting data from the first link, we will obtain a list of provinces and cities  

Wiki GDP Link: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_administrative_divisions_of_Vietnam_by_GRDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_administrative_divisions_of_Vietnam_by_GRDP)  

Second Link: After collecting data from the second link, we will obtain a list of administrative units in Vietnam according to GRDP  

After combining the data collected from the web, we can construct the dashboard-The-information-about-population-and-GDP-of-provinces


In the dashboard, information about population and GDP of provinces: The first thing clearly shows us the total GDP and total population in each province, the second thing shows the total GDP of each region, the third thing shows us the top 5 regions with the highest total (GDP/per capita), and the top 5 regions with the lowest total (GDP/per capita)
